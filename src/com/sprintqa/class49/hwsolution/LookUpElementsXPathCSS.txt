Look up the following by XPATH and CSS using Chrome console:

1. What is the XPATH && CSS to find a tag with an id of "registration_container"?	
	
	XPath = //div[@id='registration_container'] 
	CSS = div#registration_container

2. What is the XPATH & CSS to find all the "span" elements on the page? How many elements are there?

	XPath = $x('//span')  
	CSS =  $$('span')  
	
	23 elements found
	
	Note: When using the Chrome Developer finder to find CSS Selector tag elements may return text matches as well.
		  To guarantee just the elements re returned use the Xpath console $x() or CSS Selector console $$() methods.    

3. What is the XPATH & CSS to find all the elements with a class attribute of "_6a" on the page? How many elements with class?

	XPath = //*[contains(@class,'_6a')]   
	CSS = *._6a  
	
	5 elements found
